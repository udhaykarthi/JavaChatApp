# JAVA Chat App

## About this Chat APP
This Java Chat App was one of my first decent projects, developed during my 2nd year as part of Project-Based Learning. At the time, I had a basic understanding of client-server communication and networking, so I decided to clone an existing chat app from GitHub and enhance it with additional features to improve both functionality and user experience.

This project marked my initial hands-on dive into socket programming, multithreaded networking, and custom UI design in Java.

## Features that i added
- Keyword-Based Emoji Reactions – Text is automatically parsed for specific keywords and replaced with emojis.
- GIF Support – Integrated with Tenor API (a Google-owned GIF database) to send GIFs in chat.
- Notifications – Real-time desktop Sound Alerts for incoming messages.
- Multi-User Support – Multiple users can log in and chat across the same network (LAN).
- UI Enhancements – Revamped user interface with custom styles for better usability.

## Things i learnt douring this project
Although the base code was cloned, working on this project helped me reverse-engineer the server-client communication model and understand the design patterns used by the original author
This project laid the foundation for more advanced chat-based systems I worked on later, such as:

 - Roogle – A search-integrated chat platform
 - StudyGuys – A collaborative academic chat system built with my team
